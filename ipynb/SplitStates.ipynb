    "# Split the States\n",
    "\n",
    "The [538 Riddler for 11 June 2021](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-split-the-states/) poses this problem  (paraphrased):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given a map of the lower 48 states of the  USA, remove a subset of the states so that the map is cut into two  disjoint contiguous regions that are near-halves by area. Call the regions *A* and *B*, where *A* has the larger area. You can treat Michigan’s upper and lower peninsulas as two non-adjacent \"states,\" for a total of 49. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> To be precise, 538's question is: \n",
    "> 1. What states should you remove to maximize the area of *B*? What is *B*'s area and percent of the country's area?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> There is some ambiguity in the phrase \"near-halves by area\" and [Philip Bump](https://twitter.com/pbump/status/1400185939629117442) is interested in another question:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2. What states should you remove to minimize the difference of the area of *A* and the area of *B*? \n",
    ">\n",
    "> Bump hypothesized that {IL, MO, OK, NM} is the best subset to remove. Is he right?\n",

    "Let's start by clarifying some concepts:\n",
    "- **State**: denoted by the standard 2-letter abbreviations like `'CA'` (plus `'UP'` and `'LP'` for the Michigan peninsulas). \n",
    "- **States**: a set of states; implemented as a (hashable) `frozenset`. I'll use `states('OR CA')` for  `frozenset({'OR', 'CA'})`.\n",
    "- **Region**: a set of states that are **contiguous**—they are all connected by a single tree of **neighbor** relations.\n",
    "- **Neighbor**: a relation saying two states share a border. Implemented as [adjacency sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list) in the dict `neighbors`.\n",
    "- **Cut**: a set of states that, when removed from the map, cuts the map into disjoint regions. \n",
    "- **Split**: a tuple `(A, B, C)`, where  `A` and `B` are the two regions made by the cut `C`, with `A` larger than `B`.\n",
    "- **Border**: the states on the edge of the map (neighbors of Canada, Mexico, Atlantic, or Pacific).\n",
    "- **Area**: Each state has an area in square miles, given by the `areas` dict, and a region has a total area, given by the function `area`.\n",

    "\n",
    "I have four ideas to limit the number of cuts:\n",
    "- **Make cuts small in number of states.** I'll consider subsets of up to 8 states.  That reduces the possibilites a million-fold to 500 million.\n",
    "- **Make cuts small in area.** A large area in the cut means there won't be much area left to make region *B* big. I'll limit the cut area.\n",
    "- **Make cuts contiguous.** Noncontiguous cuts can't be optimal for question 1, so I won't consider them.\n",
    "- **Make cuts go border-to-border.** A cut can produce exactly two regions only if (a) the cut runs from one place on the border to another place on the border or (b) the cut forms a \"donut\" that surrounds some interior region. The US map isn't big enough to support a decent-sized donut (there are only 14 non-border states, and only two of those, KS and NE, are not neighbors of a border state). Therefore I'll look only for cuts that go border-to-border. \n",

Then in each iteration of the `while` loop, it yields each region from  the current set of regions, and creates a new set of regions formed by adding a neighboring state to a current region in all possible ways, as long as the area does not exceed `maxarea` and the size does not exceed `maxsize`.

The cut {ID, OR, NV, AZ} leaves three regions: {WA}, {CA}, and {everything else}. To verify whether the cut makes two regions, `make_splits` first finds a maximal-size contiguous region `A` from the non-cut states, then finds a region `B` from the remaining states, then checks that `A` and `B` are non-empty and make up all the non-cut states.\n",

To prove that we have the best cut, we'll have to eliminate those constraints, allowing cuts of any number of states going between any border states. This will increase run time, probably by an order of magnitude. Fortunately, we can tighten the area constraint tobring that down a bit. We found that the cut {CO, IL, MO, NE, NM} produces a region *B* with area 1,344,149, so that means that any cut that is better for question 1 must create a split where the areas of both *A* and *B* are greater than 1,344,149, Therefore, we can lower `maxarea` from 638,220 to:"
